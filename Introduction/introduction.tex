Being extremely interested in everything having a relation with the Machine Learning, the final year project was a great occasion to devote time to learn and confirm the interest for this field. The fact that machine learning can make estimations, predictions and give the ability for machines to learn by themselves is both powerful and limitless in terms of application possibilities.\\
Machine learning can be used in finance, medicine, almost everywhere. Hence that is the pivotal motivation of carrying out the final year project around machine learning domain.




\section{Problem Definition}
% Content of the problem definition goes here
In India, there are multiple real estate classified websites where properties are listed for sell/ buy/ rent purposes such as 99acres, housing, commonfloor, magicbricks and more. However, in each of these websites we can see lot of inconsistencies in terms of pricing of an apartment and there are some cases when similar apartments are priced differently and thus there is lot of in-transparency. Sometimes the consumers may feel the pricing is not justified for a particular listed
apartment but there no way to confirm that either. Proper and justified prices of properties can bring in a lot of transparency and trust back to the real estate industry, which is very important as for most consumers especially in India the transaction prices are quite high and addressing this issue will help both the customers and the real estate industry in the long run. We propose to use machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to develop an algorithm that can predict housing prices based on certain input features.\\
The business application of this algorithm is that classified websites can directly use this algorithm to predict prices of new properties that are going to be listed by taking some input variables and predicting the correct and justified price i.e. avoid taking price inputs from customers and thus not letting any error creeping in the system. This study on proactive pricing of houses in the Indian context has never been reported earlier in the literature to the best of our knowledge.\\
However, the problem of house price prediction is quite old and there have been many studies and competitions addressing the same including the classic Boston housing price challenge on Kaggle. As far as housing price prediction in Indian context is concerned, use of machine learning algorithm can really get the job done.

\section{Selection of Life Cycle Model for Development}
% Content inside the selection of life cycle model

In order to accomplish the stated objective, Agile model is selected as software development life cycle model. The incentive behind selecting Agile model is because requirements
are stated clearly but the machine learning model needs to be trained and tested for better prediction on unseen data which makes the implementation and testing phase repetitive.
