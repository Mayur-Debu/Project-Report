Design is a meaningful engineering representation of something that is to be built. It can be traced to system requirements and at the same time assessed for quality against a set of predefined criteria for ”good” design. Software design sits at the technical kernel of software
engineering and is applied regardless of software process model that is used. Software design is the first of three technical activities-design, code generation and test that are required to build and verify the software.\\
The respective chapter will discuss about the proposed system design. Section 4.1 will discuss about the system architecture. Data Flow Diagram’s are discussed in section 4.2. Section 4.3 contains the UML diagrams. Finally the summary in last section.
